# Up

Up is a system development and deployment browser.

## Usage

Add the following line to your project's ```project.clj``` file.

    :plugins [[lein-up "0.0.1"]]

Start like this :-

    lein up

## Development

Install the up components to your local repo, then test them using an
example project. Currently there is no super-fast feedback cycle in
hacking up, but that will come.

    lein sub install
